# Hilo
Are you willing to risk everything? Play Hilo and you might be surprised. The rules are simple. 
Out of 13 cards, the current card is displayed. The player guesses if the next card will be higher 
or lower. The player earns 100 points if they guessed correctly. The player loses 75 points if they 
guessed incorrectly. If a player reaches 0 points the game is over. If a player has more than 0 points 
they decide if they want to keep playing. If a player decides not to play again the game is over.
